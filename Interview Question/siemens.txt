Interview Questions in Siemens
First round 
Core Java: 
==========
1. What is exception? 
Ans:==>Exception is an object that represents a logical mistake occurred in the program due to
    wrong input given by enduser during program execution.

2. What is checked and unchecked exception? 
Ans:==>Checked Exception :=>The exception which is checked by compiler for smooth execution of the 
    program at runtime are called Checked Exception.
     eg:=>FileNotFoundException
          SQLException
          HallTicketMissingException(CustomeException)
          PenNotWorkingException(CustomException)   
    In the case of Checked Exception compiler will check whether we are handling exception if the 
    programmer not handling then we get compile time error.

    Unchecked Excpetion:=>The exceptions which are not checked by compiler are called Checked
    Exceptions.
      eg:=>ArithmeticException
           NullPointerException
           BombBlastException(CustomeException)
    In the case of UncheckedException compiler won't check whether programmer handling exception
    or not

3. Which one u prefer to handle exception try-catch or throws? 
Ans==>try-catch

4. In your project how u handle the exception in which layer and how u map ?
Ans:=>In our project we did not eat or surpress the exceptions in any layer of business tier always
   deligate or forward the exception to controller component by converting into application specific
   exception. so that the controller servlet can display error page showing the exception.
    
 



5. Which collection u used in your project write some pseudo code? 
Ans:==> We are mainly List and Map collection used in our project.
            A collection is a java container object it is used for storing multiple homogenous and 
        heterogenous object ,unique and duplicate object without size limitation further it is used 
        for carrying all objects at a time from one class to another class as method arguments and 
        return value.
            We are used collection object(List,Map) in DAO classes for storing all customer,students
       (as per ur project required) information without size limitation as many record as available
       in DataBase and further we want to transfer(return) all these customer,student(as per ur 
       project) information at a time from DAO classes to service classes and from service class to 
       controller classes for displaying on browser.
       Write some pseudo code:
       =======================

6. Difference between HashMap and HashTable ?
Ans:==>HashMap:
       =======
       1. In HashMap no method is synchronized and its object are not thread-safe.
       2. Performance is high.
       3. HashMap contains one null key and multiple null values.
      
      HashTable:
      ========= 
       1. In Hashtable all methods are synchronized and hence it is thread safe.
       2. Performance is low compare to HashMap.
       3. Null insertion is not possible for both key and value voilation lead NullPointerException.


7. If 2 thread try to access my collection Object at same time then is there any problem? 
   If yes how can I handle this? 
Ans:==>Yes,the problem is data inconsistency.
       To overcome these problem we should go for synchronized keyword.If a method or blocks declared
       as synchronized then at a time only one thread is allow to execute that method or block on the
       given object.so that data inconsistency problem is resolved.

8. What is synchronization, and what are the various places where we can use it 
Ans:==>Synchronization is a modifier applicable only for methods and blocks but not for classes and 
      variables. The process of allowing multiple threads to modify an object in sequence is called
      synchronization.We can allow multiple threads modifying the object sequentially only by 
      executing that object's mutator methods logic in sequence from multiple threads. 
      This possible by using object locking concept.

9. What is static keyword, where we have to prefer that keyword and why? 
Ans:==>The class level members which have static keyword in their definition are called static member.
       Java supports 4 types of static members
        1.static variable
        2.static block
        3.static method
        4.static main method
       All static members are identified and get memory location at the time of class loading by 
       default by JVM in method area.

10. What is the difference between static block and static method? 
Ans:==>

11. Can i access an instance field from static context? 
Ans:==> No

12. Can i call a static method through the object reference? 
Ans:==>Yes

13. Can i declare a class as private? 
Ans:==>No

14. HashMap internal works? 
Ans:==>

15. programme: i have one string 9845321067 I have to sort the string in reverse order 
    o/p:-9876543210 without using any predefined method 

16. What is polymorphism?Give one example?
Ans:==>It is one thing but multiple behaviour.
       Polymorphism means "mean forms".
       Single form behaving differently in different situation.
       A single function or single characters in different places.
       eg:->President in home acts as husband and parent.
           and office acts good president.
       polymorphism refers to the ability of two or more objects belogining to different
       clases to respond exactly to the same message in class specific ways.
        

Hibernate:
========= 
1. If JDBC is there why hibernate? 
2. Can I reuse the session? If yes how if no then what is the problem? 
3. What is the difference between level-1 and level-2 cache? 
4. Difference between get and load? 
5. Difference between update and merge? 
6. What is the state of object? 
7. What is the lazy attribute and how it works? 
8. How u configure data Source and name of the data Source? 

Spring: 
=======
1. What is dependency injection? 
Ans:==>If the underlying server or container dynamically assign the 
       dependent value to our resources (objects/classes) program then 
       it is called Dependency Injection.

       There are 4 types of dependenecy Injection
         1. Setter Injection (We can inject through setter method call)
         2. Constructor Injection(We can inject through parameterized constructor)
         3. Aware Injection or Interface Injection
         4. Lookup Method Injection
       
2. What is the spring MVC annotation you used in your project? 
Ans:==>There are many sprng mvc annotations used in our project.
       1.@RequestParam
       2.@ModelAttribute
       3.@RequestMapping
       4.@Controller
       5.@Service
       6.@Resource
       7.@Autowire
       8.@Bean
       9.@InitBinder
      10.@Inject
      11.@Qualifier and etc..

3. Explain the Spring MVC flow relate with your project architecture? 
Ans:==>Explain Spring MVC flow with respect to your project..
      
4. For every request I have to trace the IP address of user note :
    ( before control will come to the my controller class I want to trace) 
Ans:==>Please post this question on Facebook sriman_java group.

5. What is AOP? 
Ans=>AOP is the methodlogy of programming that makes the programmer primary logics of application
     from the secondary logics or helper logics.AOP is not replacement for OOP
     more ever it complements for OOP.
     In AOP we develop business methods in classes by mixing up both primary,secondary logics.
     Due to this bussiness method becomes heavy and reusability of secondary logics will be killed 
     we cannot enable or disable secondary logics without touching source code of bussoness method.
         To overcome this method use AOP that makes the programmer to write primary logics in
     separate class and secondary logics in another class and allow to mix and bind both logics
     dynamically at runtime by generating new class.

6. What is the difference between join point and point cut? 
Ans==>JoinPoint:=>The possible points in classes on which aspect logics can be applied is 
                  called Joinpoint.They are like fields,Constructor,methods and etc..
                  Spring supports only methods at jointpoint.

      PointCut:=> It is a collections of jointpoint on which apsects are applied
                 (i.e apsect are configured)

7. What is the difference between interceptor and around advice in spring AOP? 
ANs:==>

8. Can we access stored procedure through spring? 
Ans:==>Yes, by using SpringJdbc

9. Can I write 2 times init() method in bean? 
Ans:==>

10. In my application unused bean is there I don't want to instantiate that bean how can I handle?
Ans:==>
